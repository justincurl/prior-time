        On the following 6 pages, we would like you to imagine you are looking backward at <strong>past economic growth
            over a four-year period.</strong>
        <br><br>
        You will see figures with measurements of how much better off people were in <strong>two different years of this
            four-year period,</strong> and you will be asked to choose which combination was best. So, in each decision,
        you will be choosing economic growth rates for a randomly selected two years of the total four-year period.
        <br><br>
        The measurements shown are <strong>personal income growth:</strong> the percentage by which the average person’s
        income increased in a given year. This provides a good measure of what the strength of the national economy was.
        <br><br>
        In the following questions, you’ll be asked to choose combinations of growth rates. As you will see, there is a
        trade-off: As growth went down for one year, it went up for the other. Each screen asks about a different pair
        of years – <strong>please pay close attention to which two of the four past years you are asked to
            consider</strong>.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Here's an example:</strong>
    <div align="center"><img src={{instructions_image_link}} width=70%></div>
    The example shows combinations of growth in the <strong>second year</strong> and the <strong>fourth year</strong> of
    the four-year period. There are six different options to choose from. For example, the leftmost response button
    combines 0 percent growth in the second year and 2 percent growth in the fourth (more recent) year. The rightmost
    button combines 2.5 percent growth in the second year and 0 percent growth in the fourth year.
    <br><br>
    In this example, the person making the decision thought that 1 percent growth in the second year and 1.2 percent in
    the more recent fourth year was the best economy overall, and therefore marked the third button from the left.
    <br><br>
    Remember, you are choosing between pairs of <strong>past economic growth,</strong> so the fourth year was more
    recent than the second year of the period.
